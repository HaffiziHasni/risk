This is for moneylion data scientists test.

put the main data on data (payment.csv, loan.csv,clarity_underwriting_variables.csv)
in the data file.

make sure the requirements are installed as per requirements.txt

codes are written in python 3.11.1

also, git version 2.39.0.windows.2

repo is private (https://github.com/HaffiziHasni/risk) so hit me up if you need to clone 

time Spent: ~72 hours

also no difference in main.py and main.ipynb, i just got tired on running everything everytime i introduce a new module on main.py so i used main.ipynb but it turns out i have to reset
the kernel everytime i change my module, but it was too late to go back to the py file so I just went with it.

Code refactoring is needed further to adhere to development principles.
however, i tried my best to follow them.
Code is Modular and follows DRY and KISS to a certain extent.
I still repeated some codes that could be eliminated and there
is more room to simplify and reduce complexity

Code should be open for modification when needed due to it being Modular

tried my best to make variables as descriptive as possible
